# Getting Started with Help

Welcome to the Help & Info panel. This panel provides contextual help and explanations for all features in the workspace.

Throughout the workspace, you'll find small question mark icons next to parameters, methods, and features. Click any of these icons to learn more about that specific topic.

You can also use the search bar above to find information on any topic, or browse the glossary to explore available help articles.

The Help panel is designed to assist biologists and researchers who may not be familiar with the technical details of image processing methods. Each article explains what a feature does, why it matters, and how changing parameters affects your results.
