# Batch Operations

Select multiple files to download or delete them together.

## Selecting Files

- Click the checkbox next to any file to select it

- Use the 'Select All' checkbox in the header to select all visible files

- Selected files are highlighted

## Batch Toolbar

## When files are selected, a toolbar appears showing:

- Count of selected files

- Download button (⬇️): Downloads all selected as a single ZIP

- Delete button (🗑️): Deletes all selected (with confirmation)

- Clear button (✕): Deselects all files

## Batch Download

Selected files are packaged into a ZIP file preserving folder structure. Useful for:

- Downloading multiple results at once

- Creating partial backups of specific files

- Sharing selected files with colleagues

## Batch Delete

Removes multiple files at once. A confirmation dialog shows the count and warns that deletion cannot be undone.

Tip: Use search to filter files first, then 'Select All' to quickly select a specific category of files.
