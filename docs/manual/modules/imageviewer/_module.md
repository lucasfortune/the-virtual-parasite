# Image Viewer Module

View TIFF image stacks with gallery and thumbnail modes. Browse individual slices, zoom, pan, and quickly navigate through your data.

The Image Viewer module provides a comprehensive interface for viewing TIFF image stacks commonly used in biomedical imaging.

## Key Features

- Gallery Mode: View individual slices in full-size with zoom and pan controls

- Thumbnail Mode: See an overview grid of all slices for quick navigation

- Zoom & Pan: Use mouse wheel to zoom and drag to pan when zoomed in

- Slice Navigation: Use slider, buttons, or keyboard to navigate between slices

- Integration: View results from segmentation and denoising modules directly

## Supported File Formats

The viewer supports multi-page TIFF files (.tif, .tiff), which are the standard format for microscopy image stacks. Both 8-bit and 16-bit images are supported, with automatic contrast adjustment for optimal viewing.

## Workflow

1. Select Image: Choose a TIFF stack from your workspace or recent results

2. View Image: Browse through slices using gallery or thumbnail mode
