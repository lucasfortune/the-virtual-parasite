# Viewer Controls

The viewer provides two modes for exploring your image stack: Gallery mode for detailed inspection and Thumbnail mode for quick overview.

## Gallery Mode

Gallery mode displays a single slice at full resolution with zoom and pan capabilities.

- Navigation Buttons: Use Previous/Next buttons to move between slices

- Slice Slider: Drag the slider to quickly jump to any slice

- Zoom Controls: Use +/- buttons or mouse wheel to zoom in/out

- Pan: When zoomed in, click and drag to pan around the image

- Reset: Click Reset to return to 100% zoom and centered position

## Thumbnail Mode

Thumbnail mode displays all slices as a grid of small previews. This is useful for:

- Getting an overview of the entire stack

- Quickly finding slices of interest

- Comparing different regions across slices

Click any thumbnail to switch to Gallery mode for that slice.

## File Info Display

The toolbar shows the current filename and total slice count for reference. The slice indicator shows your current position (e.g., "25/100" means you're viewing slice 25 of 100).
