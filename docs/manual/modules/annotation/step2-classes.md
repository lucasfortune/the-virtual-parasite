# Annotation Classes

Define multiple classes for different structures in your images. Each class has a unique color and label.

Classes represent different categories of structures you want to segment. For example:

- Class 1: Cell membrane

- Class 2: Nucleus

- Class 3: Background organelles

## Managing Classes

- Add Class (+): Creates a new class with an auto-assigned color

- Select Class: Click a class to make it active for painting

- Toggle Visibility: Hide/show annotations of a specific class

- Delete Class: Remove a class and all its annotations

## Class Colors

Each class is assigned a distinct color for visibility. Colors are chosen automatically to maximize contrast between classes.

## Best Practices

- Create all needed classes before starting to annotate

- Use consistent class assignments across all slices

- The active class is highlighted in the class list
