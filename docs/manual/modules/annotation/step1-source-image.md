# Source Image Selection

Select the image stack you want to annotate. You can start fresh, resume unfinished work, or edit an existing annotation.

## Data Sources

- Workspace Files: Upload or select TIFF stacks from your workspace

- Unfinished Annotations: Resume previously saved work in progress

- Existing Annotations: Edit a completed annotation (creates a new version)

## File Requirements

- Format: Multi-page TIFF (.tif, .tiff)

- Bit Depth: 8-bit or 16-bit grayscale

- Dimensions: Any size (very large files may affect performance)

## Workflow Options

- New Annotation: Start from a raw image with no existing labels

- Resume: Continue working on a previously saved unfinished annotation

- Edit: Load an existing annotation to make modifications (saves as new file)
