# Brush Size

Adjust the brush diameter for precise or broad strokes. Use the slider or keyboard shortcuts.

The brush size slider controls the diameter of both the brush and eraser tools in pixels.

Small sizes (1-10px): Precise work on boundaries and fine details

Medium sizes (10-25px): General annotation work

Large sizes (25-50px): Quickly filling large regions

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- [ - Decrease brush size by 5px

- ] - Increase brush size by 5px

The brush preview follows your cursor, showing exactly where paint will be applied.
