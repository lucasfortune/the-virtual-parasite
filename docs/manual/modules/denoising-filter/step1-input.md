# Input Image Stack

Select the TIFF image stack you want to denoise. Use workspace files or test data to try the module.

## Data Sources

- Workspace Files: TIFF stacks uploaded to your workspace

- Test Data: Built-in noisy images for testing

## File Requirements

- Format: Multi-page TIFF (.tif, .tiff)

- Bit Depth: 8-bit or 16-bit grayscale

- Content: Images with noise to be reduced

Tip: For best results, start with the test data to understand how different parameters affect the output, then apply similar settings to your own images.
