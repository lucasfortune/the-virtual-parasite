# 3D Visualization Module Guide

The 3D Visualization module provides an interactive Three.js-based viewer for exploring surface meshes generated from segmentation data. You can rotate, zoom, and pan the mesh, adjust per-class visibility and opacity, and explore internal structures using slice range controls.

For a conceptual overview, see [3D Visualization](info:visualization).

## Prerequisites

> **Before using this module**, ensure you have:
> - A mesh JSON file generated by the Mesh Generation module
> - Or a compatible Three.js JSON mesh file uploaded to your workspace

---

## Quick Start

1. **Launch module** — Click "3D Visualization" from the workspace hub (or "Open in 3D Visualization" from Mesh results)
2. **Select mesh data** — Choose a mesh JSON file from recent results or workspace
3. **Explore the mesh** — Rotate with click-drag, zoom with scroll wheel
4. **Adjust display** — Use class controls to toggle visibility and adjust opacity

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Data Selection

Select the mesh data to visualize.

#### Input Options

| Source | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Recent Results** | Mesh outputs from the Mesh Generation module | After generating a mesh |
| **Workspace Files** | Previously saved mesh JSON files | Revisiting earlier work |
| **Upload** | Custom mesh JSON files | External mesh data |

#### File Requirements

- **Format:** Three.js JSON mesh format (`.json`)
- **Content:** Must contain vertex positions, faces, and class information
- **Source:** Typically generated by the Mesh Generation module

#### Original Data Overlay

If the mesh was generated from a TIFF file in your workspace, the original imaging data can be overlaid on the 3D view. The module automatically detects this through data lineage tracking.

For more details, see [Mesh Data Selection](info:visualization.step1.mesh-data).

**Click "Next: View in 3D" to proceed to Step 2.**

### Step 2: 3D Viewer

Explore your mesh interactively with full camera and display controls.

#### Interface Layout

| Area | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **3D Canvas** | Left/Center | Interactive mesh rendering |
| **Controls Panel** | Right side | Per-class visibility, opacity, and range controls |
| **Toolbar** | Bottom of canvas | Reset and expand buttons |

---

### Camera Controls

Control how you view the mesh using mouse, keyboard, or touch.

#### Mouse Controls

| Action | How | Effect |
|--------|-----|--------|
| **Rotate** | Left-click + drag | Rotates mesh around X/Y axes |
| **Pan** | Ctrl + drag (or Cmd + drag on Mac) | Moves mesh in screen space |
| **Zoom** | Mouse wheel scroll | Zooms camera in/out |
| **Reset** | Double-click | Resets view to default |

#### Keyboard Controls

| Key | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| **Arrow keys** | Rotate mesh (left/right = yaw, up/down = pitch) |
| **Ctrl + Arrow keys** | Pan mesh in screen space |
| **R** | Reset rotation and position |
| **Esc** | Exit expanded/fullscreen mode |

#### Touch Controls (Tablet/Mobile)

| Gesture | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Single finger drag** | Rotate mesh |
| **Two-finger pinch** | Zoom in/out |
| **Two-finger drag** | Pan mesh |

> **Tip:** Double-click anywhere on the canvas to quickly reset the view to its default position and rotation.

---

### Class Controls

Each segmented class has its own control panel for customizing its appearance.

#### Visibility Toggle

- **Checkbox** next to class name
- **Check** to show the class mesh
- **Uncheck** to hide it
- Useful when classes overlap and obscure each other

#### Opacity Slider

| Setting | Range | Default |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Opacity** | 10% – 100% | 80% |

- Drag the slider to adjust transparency
- Lower opacity reveals structures behind the surface
- The visual fill shows current opacity level

#### Slice Range (for slice-based meshes only)

Some meshes support slice range selection to reveal internal structures:

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Left handle** | Set minimum visible slice |
| **Right handle** | Set maximum visible slice |
| **Range indicator** | Shows percentage of slices visible |

> **Note:** Slice range controls only appear for meshes generated with the VoxelSlices format. Standard surface meshes show only visibility and opacity.

For more details, see [Visualization Controls](info:visualization.step2.controls).

---

### Original Data Overlay

If your mesh was generated from a TIFF in your workspace, you can overlay the original imaging data.

![Screenshot: Original data overlay controls](screenshots/visualization-original-data.png)

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Visibility** | Toggle original data planes on/off |
| **Opacity** | Adjust transparency (5% – 100%, default 30%) |
| **Slice Range** | Show specific depth regions |

The original data displays as textured planes that rotate with the mesh, providing anatomical context for the segmentation.

---

### Toolbar Buttons

Located at the bottom of the 3D canvas:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Reset View** | Clears all rotations, pans, and resets controls to defaults |
| **Expand** | Enters fullscreen mode for larger viewing area |

In expanded mode:
- The canvas fills the entire viewport
- Controls panel floats in the top-right corner
- Click "Collapse" or press **Esc** to exit

---

## Mouse and Keyboard Reference

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Left-drag** | Rotate mesh |
| **Ctrl + drag** | Pan mesh |
| **Scroll wheel** | Zoom in/out |
| **Double-click** | Reset view |
| **Arrow keys** | Rotate mesh |
| **Ctrl + arrows** | Pan mesh |
| **R** | Reset rotation and position |
| **Esc** | Exit expanded mode |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Black screen / no mesh | WebGL not supported or mesh failed to load | Check browser WebGL support; try refreshing |
| Mesh appears very small | Auto-scaling issue | Use scroll wheel to zoom in |
| Can't see a class | Visibility toggled off or fully transparent | Check visibility checkbox and opacity slider |
| Controls not responding | Focus may be on input field | Click on the canvas to restore focus |
| Slice range not available | Mesh format doesn't support slicing | Only VoxelSlices format meshes have range controls |
| Original data not showing | Source TIFF not found via lineage | Regenerate mesh from a workspace file |

## Next Steps

After exploring your mesh, you can:
- **Generate another mesh** — Return to Mesh Generation with different settings
- **Export the mesh** — Download OBJ or STL files from the File Browser for use in external software
- **Refine segmentation** — If results need improvement, retrain the model or adjust annotations
