# Deep Learning Denoising

::: warning Work in Progress
This tutorial is currently being written. Check back soon for the complete guide.
:::

## Overview

Learn when and how to use the different denoising methods available in the workspace.

## What You'll Learn

- Difference between filter-based and deep learning denoising
- When to use Gaussian vs Non-Local Means filtering
- When to use N2V vs autoStructN2V
- How to evaluate denoising quality
- Best practices for different microscopy modalities

## Choosing the Right Method

| Method | Best For | Speed |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Gaussian Filter | Quick preprocessing, mild noise | Fast |
| Non-Local Means | Edge-preserving denoising | Medium |
| Noise2Void | Random noise, no clean references | Slow (training) |
| autoStructN2V | Structured + random noise | Slow (training) |
