#### Uploading Files

Files must be uploaded with a category designation. The category determines where files are stored and how they can be used.

**Step 1: Select a Category**

Click the category dropdown and choose from:

| Category | Accepted Files | Purpose |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Raw Images** | `.tif`, `.tiff` | Training data or inference input images |

| **Inference Data** | `.tif`, `.tiff` | Images to run inference on |
| **Model Files** | `.pth`, `.json` | Pre-trained model weights and config |
| **Restore Workspace** | `.zip` | Restore a previously exported workspace |

**Step 2: Upload Files**

*Option A: Click Upload*
1. Click the upload button (enabled after selecting category)
2. Select one or more files from the file dialog
3. Watch the progress bar as files upload

**Upload Progress**

During upload, you'll see:

> **Warning:** Restore completely replaces your workspace. All existing files will be deleted. Export your current workspace first if needed.

#### Navigating the File Tree

Files are organized in a hierarchical folder structure:

```
uploads/
  ├── raw/           → Raw image stacks
  └── annotations/   → Annotation masks
results/
  ├── segmentation/  → Segmentation outputs
  └── denoised/      → Denoised images
models/
  └── [session]/     → Trained models
```

**Expanding and Collapsing Folders**

- Click the **arrow** (▶) next to a folder to expand it
- Click again (▼) to collapse
- Folders are sorted before files, alphabetically within each category

**Selecting Files**

- **Single file**: Click the checkbox next to any file
- **Multiple files**: Click checkboxes on multiple files
- **Select all**: Click the "Select All" checkbox in the header
- **Clear selection**: Click the ✕ button in the batch toolbar
